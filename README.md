# Online-Examination-System
## RMI based Java application to keep track of student assignments and graphically represent their progress

### PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
This project aims to analyze the progress of every student by measuring his/her personal growth by a series of assessments set by the teacher.
The teacher assigns an assignment and the student is expected to submit it within the stipulated time. Both the students and the teachers can track the progress by viewing the progress report graphically.

### PLANNING INVOLVED
Since this project is to be developed in Java, Netbeans has been chosen as the designated software for the purpose due to its friendly GUI handling and easy adaptability with the MySQL Server.
